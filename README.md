# Hgen
Header generation for csv files.

## Overview
Hgen supplies tools for the generation of serialized headers. In situations
where overly verbose csv headers don't serve as proper column headers for data
analysis, hgen can produce short and appropriate headers and insert them into
the csv file. This can allow for easier analysis and handling of the csv data.

## Requirements
python 2.7.3

## Install
At the moment, these files are supplied "as is". I'm new to python and even
newer to packaging python code. So while the `setup.py` file is configured as
best as I could figure out, I still might be missing something and need some
second opinions on how to configure everything.

## Contribution
Suggestions and contributions to hgen are always welcome and appreciated.

This is one of my first python projects and definitely my first worth open
sourcing here on GitHub. If you don't feel like contributing actual code, but
see some glaringly obvious issues with anything from documentation, to
packaging, to even the code itself, feel free to make a [Suggestion][4] on the
wiki.

For contributing actual code, please see the [CONTRIBUTING][1] file for further
instructions.
