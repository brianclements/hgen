# Fixme
This file is an informal collection of items to improve in the codebase meant
for the internal use of the maintainers. They are items that are:

* Either too trivial or not user-facing enough to be GitHub issues
* Too general or unrefined to be in the [ROADMAP][1] file
* Miscellaneous items that have yet to be sorted

----

* add procedural errors for when tests get run out of order.
    * example: make headers before writing or isolating them
* update readme with instructions on how to use
* add functionality to prune empty rows when using `select_population_data`. In
  other words, only keep data that belongs to both sub-populations.
