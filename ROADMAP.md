# Roadmap
This file is an informal outline of goals, milestones, and other basic planning
items. The GitHub milestones page should be focused on bug fixes and other
regression items for a particular release. This file should be a scratch pad for
new features and additions by the maintainers.

## Version 0.1.1
    * double check and confirm a working setup.py file

## Unscheduled
* add interactive script
* make more modular to work within bigger projects
